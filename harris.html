        <h1>2024 Presidential Election Polls</h1>
        <p>
            In November, the United States will have its presidential election.
            In this dashboard, we'll explore the historical polling data for the top three candidates
            and whether current events, national and international, had an impact on their poll scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dashboard was inspired by <a
                href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight's
                dashboard</a>.
            The dataset is also from FiveThirtyEight, and I'm using data up to July 26, 2024. The latest version can
            be downloaded <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Kamala Harris</h2>
        <p>
            Kamala Harris is the current vice president of the United States, and she is seeking election to the office of the presidency in 2024.
            She is also a former US Senator of California (2017-2021).
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph below shows a rough average of the polling score for Harris from January - mid July 2024.
            There are also some annotations that call out important events that have occurred in the past 7 months
            that may have made an impact on Harris's poll scores. Because her candidacy was announced on July 21,
            there is insufficient historical data to draw meaningful insights for the future.
