        <h1>2024 Presidential Election Polls</h1>
        <p>
            In November, the United States will have its presidential election.
            In this dashboard, we'll explore the historical polling data for the top three candidates
            and whether current events, national and international, had an impact on their poll scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dashboard was inspired by <a
                href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight's
                dashboard</a>.
            The dataset is also from FiveThirtyEight, though I'm using data up to July 20, 2024. The latest version can
            be downloaded <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Joseph Biden</h2>
        <p>
            Joseph (Joe) Biden is the current president of the United States, and he is seeking reelection in 2024.
            He is also a former Vice President (2009-2017) and a former US Senator of Delaware (1973-2009).
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph below shows a rough average of the daily polling score for Biden from January - mid July 2024.
            There are also some annotations that call out important events that have occurred in the past 7 months
            that may have made an impact on Biden's poll scores.
