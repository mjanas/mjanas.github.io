        <h1>2024 Presidential Election Polls</h1>
        <p>
            In November, the United States will have its presidential election.
            In this dashboard, we'll explore the historical polling data for the top three candidates
            and whether current events, national and international, had an impact on their poll scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dashboard was inspired by <a
                href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight's
                dashboard</a>.
            The dataset is also from FiveThirtyEight, and I'm using data up to July 26, 2024. The latest version can
            be downloaded <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Average Poll Scores of the Top Presidential Candidates</h2>

            In each chart, you can hover over it to bring up a tooltip with more information.

        <h2>More about this dataset</h2>
        <p>
            I used a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/start-for-free-web-ui">free Azure Data Explorer cluster</a> 
            to explore the dataset; clean and filter to the top 4 candidates and polls only from 2024; and to aggregate multiple daily poll scores into averages.
            First, I ingested the dataset into my free Azure Data Explorer cluster, adjusting the schema to make sure fields such as datetimes were imported correctly.
            Then, I ran the following query to select and aggregate the data to what I needed:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let data = polls_2024_07_26
                    | where start_date > datetime(2024-01-01) and answer in ('Biden', 'Harris', 'Trump', 'Kennedy');
                    let stats = data | summarize avg(pct), stdev(pct) by answer;
                    data
                    | join kind=leftouter stats on $left.answer == $right.answer
                    | extend min_pct = avg_pct - 1 * stdev_pct, max_pct = avg_pct + 1 * stdev_pct
                    | where pct > min_pct and pct < max_pct
                    | summarize round(avg(pct), 2) by start_date, answer
                    | project Date = start_date, Candidate = answer, AverageScore = avg_pct
                </code>
            </pre>
            From Azure Data Explorer, I was able to export these query results to a csv file, and use that to build my d3 charts.
