        <h1>2024 Presidential Election Polls</h1>
        <p>
            In November, the United States will have its presidential election.
            In this dashboard, we'll explore the historical polling data for the top three candidates
            and whether current events, national and international, had an impact on their poll scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dashboard was inspired by <a
                href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight's
                dashboard</a>.
            The dataset is also from FiveThirtyEight, though I'm using data up to July 26, 2024. The latest version can
            be downloaded <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv">here.</a>

        <h2>Donald Trump</h2>
        <p>
            Donald Trump is a former president of the United States (2017-2021), and he is seeking reelection in 2024.
            He has no other political experience, however, he is a famous businessman and head of the Trump Organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph below shows a rough average of the daily polling score for Trump from January - mid July 2024.
            There are also some annotations that call out important events that have occurred in the past 7 months
            that may have made an impact on Trump's poll scores.
