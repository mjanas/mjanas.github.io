        <h1>2024 Presidential Election Polls</h1>
        <p>
            In November, the United States will have its presidential election.
            In this dashboard, we'll explore the historical polling data for the top three candidates
            and whether current events, national and international, had an impact on their poll scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dashboard was inspired by <a
                href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight's
                dashboard</a>.
            The dataset is also from FiveThirtyEight, and I'm using data up to July 26, 2024. The latest version can
            be downloaded <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv">here.</a>
        </p>
